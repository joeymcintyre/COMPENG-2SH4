# PPA1 â€“ Marquee Display with Asynchronous Input

Built a console-based marquee display using the MacUILib. Implemented asynchronous keyboard input, rolling text animation with wraparound, and character insertion between header/footer markers. Added exit/shutdown command, with optional advanced features (toggle direction, extended marquee).
