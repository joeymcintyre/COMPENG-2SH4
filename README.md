# COMPENG-2SH4 – Principles of Programming
Fundamental concepts of programming languages: data types, assignment, control constructs, basic data structures, iteration, recursion, exceptions; imperative and object-orientated paradigms; composing and testing small programs.

📘 Course Overview: 
- Introduced C programming with applications to engineering problems. Covered control structures, arrays, strings, pointers, dynamic memory, file I/O, and object-oriented principles in C++. Final project was a Snake Game implemented in C++ with MacUILib.
