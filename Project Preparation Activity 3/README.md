# PPA3 – Scavenger Hunt “Guess the Word” Game

Extended PPA2 into a simple interactive game. Used random number generation and collision detection to place collectible characters on the board. Revealed a hidden “Goal String” through player interactions, tracked move count, and managed heap-allocated objects. Implemented win/exit conditions with proper memory cleanup.
